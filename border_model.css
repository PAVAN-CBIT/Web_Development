<p>Archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed Iron Age sites that may date from 500 BCE.[13] The region comprising modern Hyderabad and its surroundings was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty from 624 CE to 1075 CE.[14] Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century, Golconda came under the control of the Kakatiya dynasty from 1158, whose seat of power was at Warangalâ€”148 km (92 mi) northeast of modern Hyderabad.[15]</p>
